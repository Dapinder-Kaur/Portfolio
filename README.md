# Portfolio
This is the directory designed to store the files that link to my portflio website hosted on GitHub pages. The files include, index.html which is of course the main HTML file that contains the main content of the webpage, the forms directory is within this, which is accept any forms or responses through the website which however, I am not using for my current portfolio website. Then, the assets directory contains the images, vendor etc. that give styles to different parts of the webpage. The main.css is the style sheet that helps in formatting the website and the javascript is the file where the main logic of the website os written. And this all makes the website run on its own!
